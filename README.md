We would like to guide beginner chefs in their cooking adventures. On the app Cheferone you can view recipes and add those recipes to a planner. Unlike competitors such as AllRecipes and Spoonacular, your ingredients will not be separated by recipe. On Cheferone, the ingredients from each recipe will be placed on one centralized list. To even further simplify your shopping experience, quantities of ingredients will be combined! On your centralized list, a half a pound of beef from your spaghetti recipe and a half a pound of beef from your burger recipe will be simplified to one pound of beef. 

To transform Cheferone from an idea to a usable app, the Foodies team will be utilizing Android Studio for app development and the Spoonacular api for access to hundreds of thousands of recipes.
