Usability: 
- The basic tasks will be to browse/search multiple recipes and their contents, to add desired recipes to a planner,
  to see your added recipes in that planner, and to see a combined list of ingredients from your added recipes
- The interface will be simple and recognizable. The foodies will take inspiration from other food apps to create
  familiarity for the users. 
- The number of different buttons will be kept to a minimum and the buttons will have obvious connotations around
  them such as the magnifying glass for the search function and the plus sign for the add recipe.
Reliability:
- Basic functions - browse recipes, view recipes, add recipes, etc will work as expected and if there are errors 
  it will be properly handled.
- the app will work as long as the user has internet and as long as there is no problems on the spoonacular side
  (the api being used to get the recipe data).
Performance: 
- As long as there is a good network to be connected to, all of Cheferone will run smoothly. Wait times should
  never exceed 5 seconds.
- Due to there not being any interaction between users and all the data being kept on the users phone and on the
  spoonacular database, the number of users is only limited by how many users/api calls spoonacular can handle. 
Supportability: 
- Cheferone will be available on the Google Play Store. 
- Any failures in the app will be attended to by the Foodies team within 48 hours.
